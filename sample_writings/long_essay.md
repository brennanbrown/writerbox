## Prologue: An Odd Expression

[The earliest version of the phrase appears in 1678](https://grammarphobia.com/blog/2021/08/skin-a-cat.html) in John Ray's collection of English proverbs, the equally horrible-and-bizarre "there are more ways to kill a dog than hanging." By the early 1700s, the British were saying ["there are more ways of killing a cat than choking it with cream,"](https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/there-is-more-than-one-way-to-skin-a-cat.html) a delightfully absurd image if you think about it, as if choking a cat with dairy were the default method anyone would consider. The modern American version [first appeared in print around 1840](https://grammarist.com/phrase/more-than-one-way-to-skin-a-cat/) in Seba Smith's "The Money Diggers," where he wrote

> "This is a money digging world of ours; and, as it is said, 'there are more ways than one to skin a cat,' so are there more ways than one of digging for money." 

Smith wrote as though everyone already knew the phrase. [Mark Twain used it in 1889](https://www.worldwidewords.org/qa-mor1.html) in *A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court*:

> "She was wise, subtle, and knew more than one way to skin a cat"

Meaning she knew multiple strategies to get what she wanted. Some optimistically claim the "cat" is actually short for catfish, which must be skinned before cooking since they lack scales. But the [phrase's evolution from dogs to cats, from hanging to choking to skinning](https://grammarphobia.com/blog/2021/08/skin-a-cat.html), suggests this is regional reinterpretation of a much older proverbial pattern.

[Before cats entered the picture at all](https://proverbs_en_uk.en-academic.com/3573/there_are_more_ways_of_killing_a_dog_than_by_hanging), the English said:

> "There are more ways to the wood than one."

A gentler metaphor about reaching a destination via different paths. That isn't what stuck, though. Somewhere along the way, we traded walking peacefully to the forest for the visceral, violent image of removing an animal's pelt. 

The violence makes it memorable. Makes us wince. The discomfort is why the saying has endured. 

We are forced to reckon with the fact that solutions to problems, even when they achieve the same end, can look radically, disturbingly different from one another.

I invoke this phrase now, despite its grimness, because I am trying to articulate what has been gnawing at me. How we live in a world demanding singular answers. One right way, one true path, one correct interpretation. But this expression suggests the opposite.

There are profound truths we all reach for, but we reach in such different ways, we kill and wage war with one another over this. The conclusions we come to are not only incorrect, but will damn us eternally.

I believe the opposite. The multiplicity doesn't diminish the truth; it confirms it.

Multiple ritual and moral languages may be different ways of touching the same 'more-than-material' reality (or at least the same human recognition of meaning). There are things we cannot prove, but universally recognize. The materialist explanation for human behaviours: the reduction of love to oxytocin, how grief to neural firing patterns, how the sacred to adaptive evolutionary behaviour. Both true and utterly insufficient.

Different paths can lead to the same human end—if the end is earnest, and pursued in good faith And what I'm trying to say is this: maybe the goal we're all reaching for, across every culture and century, is to acknowledge that the material world is not all there is. We are surrounded by mystery. Something beyond the measurable shapes everything we are.

And there are more ways than one to reach toward that mystery correctly.

## Rendering Pretty Colours in the Terminal

There are more ways than one to respect the dead.

Their most popular kind of parties are funerals. | <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collin_key/30675124431">source</a></figcaption>

The [Toraja people](https://come2indonesia.com/toraja-culture-sulawesi/) in the highlands of Sulawesi, Indonesia, build elaborate tongkonan houses with distinctive boat-shaped roofs pointed toward the sky. Here, death is not a single moment but a slow unfurling across days, weeks, years. Families practice funeral ceremonies lasting 3-10 days where deceased members are kept at home, dressed, given food. For they are not dead until buried properly. The journey to Puya is gradual, the afterlife waiting beyond the mountains. The air fills with the sound of drums and the bellowing of water buffaloes, sometimes fifty, sometimes a hundred, whose sacrifice marks the status of the departed. 

Every few years comes [Ma'nene](https://authentic-indonesia.com/blog/5-sacred-and-unique-funeral-traditions-in-toraja/), when families climb to ancient cliff-face vaults, bring down their ancestors, wash their bones, dress them in fresh silk and batik, brush their hair. Photographs are taken in modern times, the living holding the mummified dead, smiling. 

If any of this feels strange, it's worth remembering how strange our own burial norms would look to an outsider.

Travel west and north to the Himalayas, to designated mountaintops across Tibet, Mongolia where vultures circle the high plateaus. [Sky burial (jhator)](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/sky-burial) give offering to the hungry birds. Pogyapas, *body breakers*, perform sacred work in the thin, cold air. The deceased is dismembered, bones crushed and mixed with tsampa flour, every part given to the waiting, patient vulture. 

The body is an empty vessel after the consciousness has departed in [Vajrayana Buddhist](https://www.tibettravel.org/tibetan-local-customs/tibetan-funeral.html). The practice is a final act of generosity. Flesh feeding wings, the body sustaining life even after death.[About 80% of Tibetans](https://www.wondersoftibet.com/about-tibet/tibetan-sky-burial/) choose this path, making it more common than burial or cremation. The vultures rise on thermals, carrying what remains toward the sun.

<figcaption>Famadihana is a deeply rooted cultural practice in Malagasy society, where it's believed that the dead continue to influence the lives of the living. The ceremony is often accompanied by songs, dances, and festivities, and it's generally organized every 5 to 7 years, though this can vary by region and family. | <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:FAMADIHANA_MPMF24.jpg">source</a></figcaption>

Southwest across the Indian Ocean to [Madagascar](https://ideas.ted.com/11-fascinating-funeral-traditions-from-around-the-globe/), [Famadihana](https://www.funeralguide.co.uk/blog/death-around-the-world-famadihana-madagascar), translating to the "turning of the bones", is practiced every five to seven years. Families descend on ancestral tombs with bands playing salegy music, horns bright in the tropical air. Crypts are opened, unwrapping the bundled dead from old shrouds. Handling bones that have been slowly giving back to earth with grace. Fresh silk, handwoven and perfumed, are wrapped around each ancestor while families dance, lifting bodies above their heads, circling the tomb seven times. 

The Malagasy believe the dead appreciate celebration and joy. Remembering the music they once danced to. Spirits don't ascend to join ancestors until fully decomposed, and until then, they deserve parties. Expecting women take fragments of ancestral shrouds, believing the blessing of the dead can quicken new life.

[In Ghana](https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/ghana-fantasy-coffins/), master carpenters build fantasy coffins shaped like Mercedes-Benzes for businessmen, oversized fish for fishermen, enormous Bibles for the devout—believing the dead continue their professions in the afterlife, buried to honour their earthly work. [In Aboriginal Australia](https://nga.gov.au/first-nations/the-aboriginal-memorial/burial-ceremonies/), bodies are placed on tall platforms covered in leaves and left for months to decompose, the spirit returning to the land before being reborn. [In New Orleans](https://64parishes.org/entry/jazz-funerals-and-second-line-parades), jazz bands lead funeral processions, playing dirges until the dead are buried, then shifting to jubilant music, dancing through the streets to celebrate the life that was lived.

And so I ask, is only one tradition correct? A single path to salvation? That seems like such a narrow and ridiculous question to ask. It is perhaps more logical to say, simply, *none* of them are correct. That none of this is actually respecting the dead because there is no actual way for us to communicate with those who have died, and that all we have is this one finite, brief, and absurd life.

This thinking can be applied to a lot of things, can't it? It is easy to succumb to this conclusion and to perceive the universe as cold and mechanical, and that there is no meaning or purpose for any particular thing, and that it is all for naught.

## Part Two: Our Inherent Nature

[Babies born blind smile](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5902524/). Babies born deaf laugh. When researchers at the [University of Geneva analyzed 21 scientific studies](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170704093813.htm) from 1932 to 2015, they found that people born blind spontaneously produce the same facial expressions as sighted people when experiencing genuine emotions. [Those born both deaf and blind](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5902524/) display expressions of happiness identical to those who can see and hear. The same muscles activate. The same joy radiates from faces that have never witnessed another human smile. Studies of [blind athletes at the 2004 Paralympic Games](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/07/170704093813.htm) showed they articulated happiness and disappointment in the same ways as sighted competitors, including the forced smiles of those who finished second, so achingly close to their goal. 

These expressions emerge from something deeper than imitation, something encoded in our very bones.
