This file has no YAML frontmatter at all.

It should still be displayed by WriterBox, but will be categorized as "uncategorized" since there's no category field.

This is an important edge case to test how the application handles files that don't follow the expected format.

WriterBox should gracefully handle such files and not crash when encountering missing frontmatter.
